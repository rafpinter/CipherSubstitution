# CipherSubstitution

CipherSubstitution enciphers a text according to your patter.

## Usage

You will need a 26 characters long key that is going to serve as a new alphabet order.

```bash
./ciphersubstitution qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
```

Every letter in your text will be substituted by the corresponding letter on your key.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

Ciphertext: ygg


Plaintext: bar
Ciphertext: wqk


Plaintext: baz
Ciphertext: wqm
