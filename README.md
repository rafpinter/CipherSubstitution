# CipherSubstitution

CipherSubstitution enciphers a text according to your patter.

## Usage

You will need a 26 characters long key that is going to serve as a new alphabet order.

```bash
./ciphersubstitution qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
```

Every letter in your text will be substituted by the corresponding letter on your key.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

## Examples

```bash
Plaintext: foo
Ciphertext: ygg
```

```bash
Plaintext: bar
Ciphertext: wqk
```

```bash
Plaintext: baz
Ciphertext: wqm
```
